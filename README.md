## Summary

In my prior research, I've identified an anomalously large precipitation trend in the southeastern United States during the fall season. In an attempt to seek out the dominant driver, I was able to link it to an intenification and/or westward expansion of the North Atlantic Subtropical High, but was unable to definitively link it to SST or anthropogenic forcing. Given the existence of other semipermanent subtropical High pressure systems globally, I would like to investigate other regions that have unusually large fall precipitation trends (via linear regression) and attempt to link their increases to circulation induced by intensified anticyclonic flow around the western edge of each respective subtropical High (via correlation). If identified, I will also attempt to link a global intensification in subtropical Highs to global increases in sea-surface temperatures and surface air temperatures.

## Research Question

1) Given the known link between one subtropical High and a regional fall precipitation trend, can we identify a global pattern in fall precipitation and subtropical High pressure intensity?

    Hypothesis 1: Global precipitation patterns will exist along the western edge of subtropical Highs.

2) If a global pattern exists, can we link the subtropical High intensification with global sea-surface temperatures or surface air temperatures?

    Hypothesis 2: Global increases in subtropical High intensification will be linked to warming
    temperatures globally, although more work will likely be needed to disentangle concurrent
    trends that likely drive the increased correlations.
    
## Data

I will verify precipitation trends across 3 global datasets and use reanalysis surface temperature and an observational product for sea-surface temperature:

1) NCEP Reanalysis Precipitation & Surface Temperature: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html

2) GPCC Precipitation: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.gpcc.html

3) CRU Precipitation: https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/

4) Hadley Centre Sea Surface Temperature data set (HadISST):https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/
